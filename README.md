# Booth #

P2P Micro Chatroom

----------

## About ##

Booth is a tiny chat room with only room for 2 people. You will be able to video chat, text chat and transfer files. The connections between users will be P2P using WebRTC, so no chat data will pass through the server.

## Development Status ##

Very much work-in-progress. Only raw camera view is working at present. Some open STUN/TURN servers are being used at the moment. If possible I would like to build in STUN/TURN capabilities without the need for third party servers.

## Roadmap ##

The aim is to eventually have the following features when in chat:

- Video (Webcam)
- Audio (Microphone)
- Text Chat
- File Transfer

Outside of chat:

- Notification of when booth is available
- Lobby area when waiting for booth to be available
